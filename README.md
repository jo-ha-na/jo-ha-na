👋 Hi, I’m @jo-ha-na! 🌟
👀 I’m interested in music 🎶 and learning all sorts of useless trivia. I also love to travel ✈️ and I spend a lot of time coding! 💻
🌱 I’m currently learning new coding techniques and exploring different programming languages. 🚀
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects that challenge me and allow me to grow as a developer.
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on GitHub or drop me a message on social media! 📱
😄 Pronouns: She/Her
⚡ Fun fact: My favorite animal is the elephant 🐘 because, just like me, it can't jump! 🚫🦘 
But who needs jumping when you can stomp around with such grace and majesty? 🌟
